This is Caja-Dropbox, a fork of Nautilus-Dropbox for MATE Desktop.


Building Dropbox Caja Extension From Source Tarball
--------------------------------------------------

You will need the following packages (or equivalent):

libcaja-extension-dev

In the caja-dropbox dir just do:
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ sudo make install

After installing the package you must restart Caja. You can do that by issuing the following command (note: if you're running compiz, doing so may lock up your computer - log out and log back in instead):

$ killall caja
