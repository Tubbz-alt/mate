Description: MATE session settings daemon (metapackage)
 This package contains the daemon which is responsible for setting the
 various parameters of a MATE session and the applications that run
 under it. It handles the following kinds of settings:
 .
  * Keyboard: layout, accessibility options, shortcuts, media keys
  * Clipboard management
  * Theming: background, icons, GTK+ applications
  * Cleanup of unused files
  * Mouse: cursors, speed, accessibility options
  * Startup of other daemons: screensaver, sound daemon
  * Typing break
 .
 It also sets various application settings through X resources and
 freedesktop.org XSETTINGS.
 .
 This is a metapackage, it depends on GStreamer or PulseAudio backends.
